# Deep-Learning-Fundamentals
This repository will contain all my work on the fundamentals of deep learning. These will usually involve basic implementations of deep learning methods using Python's Numpy library. I plan to implement basic methods in machine learning and eventually begin to implement recent methods from machine learning research. 

This project will consist of several parts. Each part will cover a certain aspect of machine learning. Below will be a list of each part and a link to the full details covering that part:
